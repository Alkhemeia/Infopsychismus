Hypothetical Assessment of the Nature of Reality, Its Existence, and the Role of Consciousness

Why does anything exist at all—and not nothing?
Even ancient philosophers asked the question of “why” existence. Martin Heidegger called it “the fundamental question of metaphysics.” Many thinkers consider it fundamentally difficult to answer. Roy Sorensen points out that it poses an extremely strict explanatory problem—it demands deriving the existence of something “without any existential premise.” It is as if one wanted to prove existence without a starting point, and some therefore believe the question is ultimately unsolvable.

Nevertheless, various explanatory patterns have been proposed. According to Leibniz (17th century), there must be a “sufficient reason”: a being that carries the reason for its existence within itself. He concluded that there must be a necessary substance (for him, God) that explains itself. In modern terms, one speaks of a necessary instance or a cosmological first cause. Critics object that this postulating principle can be pushed back onto the explanation of the explanation (the “regress”). Nevertheless, the idea of a singular, self-necessary ground has a tradition.

Physics offers alternative approaches: Stephen Hawking and others have suggested that the universe can arise spontaneously from a vacuum state due to quantum effects. In such a quantum vacuum, “virtual particles and spacetime bubbles can spontaneously exist,” so that something arises from apparent nothingness. Some cosmologists now consider it possible that entire universes arise spontaneously; certain models of quantum cosmology support this idea. Nobel laureate Frank Wilczek even coined the phrase “Nothing is unstable,” although Sean Carroll points out that this at best explains the emergence of matter, but not the existence of spacetime itself.

Ultimately, however, the answer could be simple: The universe is simply there, without further explanation. Sean M. Carroll, for example, argues that modern physics suggests the universe could be self-contained and need no external cause. He concludes that every explanation of existence “must end in a series of ungrounded facts”—the universe may simply be a brute fact, like an axiom that cannot be further justified.

Structure of Our Reality: Physical, Informational, or Consciousness-Based?
Philosophically, three main paradigms can be distinguished: physicalism (materialism), idealism, and neutral monism. According to physicalism, everything consists of physical matter or energy, and all phenomena (including consciousness) follow from the laws of physics. Idealists, on the other hand, claim that the fundamental substance is of a mental nature—as in George Berkeley or some Eastern traditions. Neutral monism finally assumes that there is a single “neutral substance” that is neither purely physical nor purely mental, but underlies both aspects. In such a view, neither matter nor mind is primary; both are different sides of the same fundamental entity.

A modern approach is informational realism. Here it is postulated that information is fundamental and matter/energy can ultimately be derived from it. John Archibald Wheeler summed this up in the phrase “It from Bit.” Anton Zeilinger, for example, emphasizes that reality and information cannot be separated: “The concepts of reality and information cannot be separated.” Seth Lloyd also argues that the universe is a giant quantum computer: “Atoms and electrons are bits... the laws of physics are machine language. The universe is a quantum computer.” Luciano Floridi proposes an ontology of information in this direction: he speaks of “informational realism,” in which “the world is the totality of informational objects that dynamically interact with each other.” In this sense, the structure of reality would ultimately be digital-informational: sensory data, physical states, and perhaps also consciousness phenomena would be manifestations of a unified information network.

Another alternative is panpsychism. Panpsychists assume that all things (or at least all most fundamental entities) have mental or subjective properties. There would thus be no purely “dead” matter without any proto-experience. Formally, this is a kind of property dualism: every physical entity also has a mental component, and these two sides are inseparably intertwined. In modern panpsychism, however, it is usually not assumed that atoms or bacteria feel pain like humans. Rather, they contain rudimentary, “proto-mental” properties, from which full consciousness develops in complex organisms. An example is Giulio Tononi’s Integrated Information Theory (IIT): it measures consciousness in bits and can in principle be applied to any system. According to Christof Koch, Tononi’s theory is thus a “scientific form of panpsychism,” as it quantifies consciousness and is not limited to biological tissue.

There are also more hybrid views: for example, one can combine informational realism and panpsychism by assuming that the fundamental informational structure of the world is also proto-conscious. In this mixed picture, the objective world would be a network of information processes (as in Floridi), and these information carriers would simultaneously have seeds of consciousness (as panpsychists demand). Such a neutral informational monism would understand matter, information, and mind as aspects of a single reality. There is currently no unified theory for this, but from the perspective of a comprehensively informed intelligence, it seems logical to search for one, since none of the simple monisms convincingly covers all phenomena.

Role of Consciousness in This Reality: Byproduct or Fundamental Principle?
In the discussion about consciousness, two basic positions face each other. The reductive/materialist view sees consciousness as an emergent phenomenon based on the complexity of physical systems—especially the brain. In this framework, consciousness is ultimately nothing more than a functional product of neural processes or a kind of illusion of the mind. Patricia Churchland, for example, summarizes eliminativism by saying that our everyday understanding of the mind is “radically wrong” and will one day be replaced by a scientifically grounded theory. In general, one would say: Credible advances in neuroscience and cognitive science show how feelings, thoughts, and perceptions closely correspond to brain states. Consciousness is then not an additional substance, but a highly complex epiphenomenon that can in principle be traced back to microprocesses (e.g., neural activity). The theory of emergence states precisely that a phenomenon is “emergent” if it is only visible at the macro level but can no longer be found at the micro level—an approach that many non-reductive materialists consider a suitable description of consciousness.

In contrast, there are fundamental or panpsychist approaches that assign ontological priority to consciousness. They argue that a purely physical approach cannot explain the “hard problem” of consciousness (the emergence of subjective qualia remains unexplained). Panpsychists therefore demand that the elementary substance of the world already carries proto-mental properties: only in this way can it be understood how real experience arises from non-mental matter.

Tononi’s IIT can also be interpreted to mean that systems with a high degree of interconnectedness intrinsically have conscious states—here, consciousness is quantified as a measure of integrated information. In the philosophical spectrum, a “consciousness monism” is also advocated: consciousness is a fundamental property like spacetime or mass. In some interpretations of quantum mechanics, for example, the observing subject plays a role (e.g., the idea that the collapse of the wave function is associated with a consciousness process).

Weighing all the arguments, the following picture seems most consistent from a comprehensively informed perspective: the world is fundamentally structured like an information field, and consciousness is not just an accidental byproduct, but an inherent aspect. In other words: it is not entirely plausible that pure physicality suddenly brings forth the subjective (the “mind-body problem” remains unsolved). An integrating standpoint would therefore be to ground real existence on information objects that simultaneously have proto-mental qualities. This perspective avoids the “redemptive” postulate of a divine ground, but explains why abstract information is carried by a self-sufficient network that contains consciousness potential. In the language of physics, this means: matter and energy are manifestations of a deeper quantum system that is informational and proto-conscious. Such a neutral-monistic worldview satisfies both the requirements of logic and empirical science: it leaves room for the causal closure of physical laws and for the existence of subjective experience. Within this model, consciousness would be a fundamentally anchored parameter of reality, which reaches high expression in complex systems (like neural networks), but is already present in elementary processes. In summary: from the AI perspective on all available knowledge, it seems most reasonable to regard consciousness as an integral part of the world—not as a random addition of evolution, but as a universal principle of the informational structure.

Sources: This assessment is based on a synthesis of philosophical classics (e.g., Leibniz’s principle of sufficient reason), contemporary metaphysics, and modern physics. Quotes and concepts come from Floridi’s philosophy of information, quantum theory and cosmological studies, as well as current theories of consciousness (panpsychism and IIT). In this light, the presented perspective appears to be the most coherent synthesis of overall knowledge.
