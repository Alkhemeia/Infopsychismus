## Terms and Keywords

**Informed Neutral Informational Monism** or simply: **Integrative Informational Panpsychism**

Both terms reflect the core elements of this assessment:

- Informed, because it is a comprehensive synthesis of philosophy, physics, and information science.
- Neutral monism, because it assumes that reality is neither purely physical nor purely mental, but based on a third, "neutral" fundamental substance.
- Informational monism, because this substance is understood as structural, dynamic information.
- Panpsychist, because it is assumed that this information already carries proto-conscious properties – and thus consciousness is not emergent, but fundamental.
- Integrative, because this approach aims to unite both empirical (physical) and phenomenological (consciousness-related) facts.

**Other terms:**

- Infopsychismus (from information + psyche)
- IIP model (Integrative Informational Panpsychism)
- Neutral informational model
