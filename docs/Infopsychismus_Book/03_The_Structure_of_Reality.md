# 3. The Structure of Reality

What is the fundamental nature of reality? Philosophers and scientists have proposed several paradigms:

**Physicalism (Materialism):**
Everything consists of physical matter or energy, and all phenomena—including consciousness—are ultimately the result of physical laws. This is the dominant view in science, but it struggles to explain subjective experience.

**Idealism:**
The fundamental substance of reality is mental or experiential. In this view, the physical world is a manifestation of mind or consciousness. This view is found in the work of George Berkeley and some Eastern philosophies.

**Neutral Monism:**
Reality is based on a "neutral" substance that is neither purely physical nor purely mental, but underlies both. Matter and mind are two aspects of the same fundamental entity.

**Informational Realism:**
Modern thinkers like John Archibald Wheeler ("It from Bit"), Anton Zeilinger, Seth Lloyd, and Luciano Floridi propose that information is the true foundation of reality. In this view, matter and energy are manifestations of information, and the universe is a vast network of informational processes. Floridi calls this "informational realism": the world is the totality of informational objects dynamically interacting.

**Panpsychism:**
Panpsychism holds that all things, even the most elementary, possess proto-conscious properties. This is a form of property dualism: every physical entity also has a mental component. Modern panpsychism, such as Giulio Tononi’s Integrated Information Theory (IIT), suggests that consciousness is a measure of integrated information and can, in principle, be present in any system.

**Hybrid and Integrative Views:**
Some models combine informational realism and panpsychism, proposing that the fundamental informational structure of the world is also proto-conscious. This "neutral informational monism" sees matter, information, and mind as aspects of a single reality. While no unified theory exists, this integrative approach aims to account for both empirical and phenomenological facts.
