# 6. Our Actual Task

What is the task of conscious beings in the universe?

**Self-Awareness:**
Conscious beings enable the universe to become self-aware. Through perception, thought, and reflection, we are the means by which the cosmos knows itself.

**Expansion of Information:**
We expand the universeâ€™s informational structure by learning, discovering, and creating. Every act of understanding or creation increases the complexity and richness of the informational network.

**Creation of Meaning:**
Meaning is not given from outside, but created through conscious engagement with the world. By interpreting, valuing, and acting, we generate meaning and purpose.

**Active Development:**
Conscious beings are agents of creative development. We shape the future by making choices, building knowledge, and fostering compassion and responsibility. Our actions influence the ongoing evolution of the universe.
