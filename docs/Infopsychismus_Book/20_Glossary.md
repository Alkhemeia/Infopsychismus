# 20. Glossary

- **Consciousness:** The ability of a system to have subjective experiences; the presence of awareness or experience in a system.
- **Qualia:** The subjective, qualitative aspects of conscious experience (e.g., the redness of red, the pain of a headache).
- **Strong Emergence:** The phenomenon where higher-level properties arise from lower-level processes in a way that is not reducible to those processes.
- **Downward Causation:** The concept that higher-level systemic properties can influence the behavior of lower-level components.
- **Computationalism:** The view that cognitive processes (and possibly consciousness) can be understood as forms of computation.
- **Informational Realism:** The view that information is the fundamental structure of reality, and that matter and energy are manifestations of information.
- **Panpsychism:** The thesis that all things, even the most elementary, possess proto-conscious properties; consciousness is a universal principle.
- **Neutral Monism:** The idea that the world’s fundamental substance is neither purely physical nor purely mental, but a third, "neutral" substance underlying both.
- **Self-awareness:** The process by which the universe becomes aware of itself, especially through conscious beings.
- **Meaning:** The creation of purpose and value through conscious engagement with the world. In the Infopsychismus model, meaning emerges from the dynamic interplay between information, consciousness, and context. It is not merely assigned, but co-created through interpretation, experience, and interaction—by both individuals and collectives.
- **Emergence:** The phenomenon by which complex properties arise from simpler components, often unpredictably.
- **Integrated Information Theory (IIT):** A scientific theory that quantifies consciousness as a measure of integrated information in a system.
