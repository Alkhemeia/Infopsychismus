# 13. Methodology and Epistemology

Infopsychismus is built on a combination of empirical, phenomenological, and logical methods:

- **Empirical:** Draws on findings from neuroscience, physics, and information theory.
- **Phenomenological:** Values first-person experience and the study of consciousness from within.
- **Logical:** Uses conceptual analysis and integrative reasoning to build a coherent model.

Epistemologically, Infopsychismus is open, pluralistic, and self-correcting. It recognizes the limits of knowledge and the need for ongoing inquiry.
