# 18. Infopsychismus and Philosophy of Language

The principles of Infopsychismus also intersect with the philosophy of language:

**Language as Information:**
Language can be seen as a system of information transfer, where symbols and sounds are used to convey meaning. This aligns with the informational realism aspect of Infopsychismus, which posits that information is the fundamental building block of reality.

**Consciousness and Language:**
The ability to use and understand language is closely tied to consciousness. Language allows for the expression and communication of conscious experiences, thoughts, and emotions. The development of language is seen as a key factor in the evolution of human consciousness.

**Proto-Consciousness and Communication:**
Even in non-human animals, forms of communication may reflect proto-conscious properties. The study of animal communication can provide insights into the evolutionary origins of consciousness and the role of information in conscious experience.

**Integrative Approach:**
An integrative approach to the philosophy of language considers the ways in which language, consciousness, and information are interconnected. It explores how language shapes our understanding of reality and how it can be used to express and communicate complex, abstract, and subjective experiences.
