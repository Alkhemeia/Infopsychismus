# 10. Historical Context and Intellectual Lineage

The ideas behind Infopsychismus have deep historical roots. From ancient philosophy to the digital age, the quest to understand consciousness, reality, and meaning has evolved through many intellectual traditions:

- **Ancient Philosophy:** Early thinkers like Plato and Aristotle debated the nature of mind, matter, and the cosmos. Eastern philosophies, such as Vedanta and Buddhism, explored consciousness as a fundamental aspect of reality.
- **Enlightenment and Modern Science:** The Enlightenment brought rationalism and empiricism, with Descartes, Spinoza, and Leibniz shaping debates on mind and substance. The rise of physics and biology introduced new models of matter and life.
- **Cybernetics and Systems Theory:** In the 20th century, Norbert Wiener, Ludwig von Bertalanffy, and others developed cybernetics and systems theory, emphasizing information, feedback, and the interconnectedness of systems.
- **Information Age:** John Archibald Wheeler’s “It from Bit,” Anton Zeilinger’s quantum information, and Luciano Floridi’s informational realism reframed reality as fundamentally informational. Panpsychism, revived by thinkers like Galen Strawson and Giulio Tononi, brought consciousness back to the center of metaphysics.

Infopsychismus synthesizes these traditions, integrating philosophy, science, and technology into a new model for the 21st century.
