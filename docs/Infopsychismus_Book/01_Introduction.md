# 1. Introduction

**Infopsychismus** is an integrative model that seeks to answer some of the most profound questions of philosophy and science: Why does anything exist? What is the fundamental nature of reality? What is consciousness, and what role does it play in the universe? And what is the meaning or purpose of conscious existence?

This book combines classical philosophy, modern science, informational realism, and panpsychism into a coherent and accessible theory. The approach is integrative: it draws on empirical findings, phenomenological insights, and logical reasoning to build a model that unites the physical, informational, and conscious aspects of reality. The goal is to make the nature of existence and the role of conscious beings understandable to anyone interested in consciousness research, metaphysics, philosophy of information, and the question of meaning.

**Key terms:**

- **Informed Neutral Informational Monism**: Reality is neither purely physical nor purely mental, but based on a third, "neutral" fundamental substance—understood as structural, dynamic information.
- **Integrative Informational Panpsychism (IIP model)**: Information is fundamental and already carries proto-conscious properties, making consciousness a universal principle rather than an emergent byproduct.
